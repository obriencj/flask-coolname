# Flask Coolname

A simple [flask] app that provides a friendly web-ui and REST
interface to [coolname].

[coolname]: https://github.com/alexanderlukanin13/coolname

Did the world need it? Nope.

Simply put, I wanted to make something simple in flask to brush
up on my javascript and css skills, which were around twenty years
out-of-date. I have designs to significantly over-complicate this
little web service. Stay tuned to see how that plays out.
